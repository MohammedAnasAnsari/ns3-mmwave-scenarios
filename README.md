# ns-3mmWave Scenarios

In this report we described several experiments conducted using the ns-3 simulator and its module mmWave.

These experiments were motivated by some research questions, namely how to determine the best positioning of 5g radio base stations.

In this repository it made available the report in PDF format, the source code base used to produce the simulation scenarios and Jupyter notebooks with the analyses and graphs used in the report.

## Scenarios considered

Each scenario considers different physical structures (e.g. buildings), actors (e.g passerby) with varying moving speeds and different numbers and positions for 5g antennas (evolved Node B). 

### Scenario 1
### Scenario 2
### Scenario 3
### Scenario 4
### Scenario 5
### Scenario 6
### Scenario 7
### Scenario 8
### Scenario 9
### Scenario 10
