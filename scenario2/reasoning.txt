In this scenario 40 user devices concentrated
in the same spot (simulating users in a bus) 15 meters
from 1 eNBs will be simultated.

This scenario is exacltly like scenario1 except that instead of having 5 eNBs at the
same location now there is only one.

With this we can conclude if the eNBs intefere with each other or not, since in the
scenario one we observed that when multiple eNBs are at the same spot the UEs (also
in one single location) connects to just one eNB.
