In this scenario two real world buildings and a real world avenue are simulated together
with one UE crossing the avenue. There is one single eNB located behind one of the
buildings (from the point of view of the UE) so that during part of the simulation the
UE has direct line of sight to the eNB and in some parts it is blocked by the buildings.
Notice that the distance between the UE and the eNB changes very little during the
whole simulation. So the minimum distance is 50 meters and the maximum distance is
nearly 80 meters. Besides in this simulation in order to capture the RTT and the CWND
one remote host (i.e. a web-server over the internet) is inserted in the simulation, so that
this remote host sends data packages to each UE.
