Now in addition to the last scenario (6) we also inserted a second eNB (at the same distance
from the second UE as the first one with relation to the first UE) so that now each UE
will be getting close to an eNB at the same time that it is getting away from another.
With this scenario (7) we want to check how the UEs interfere with each other and how is
the interaction of the eNBs in the presence of the obstacles.
